From single web pages to software driven sites with hundreds of thousands of pages, Calligrafix offer a full service from domain name registration, to registration with search engines, site promotion and provision and analysis of visitor statistics.

We use the latest in development tools and techniques to deliver maintainable sites which can be updated easily as technology advances. We offer competitive, cost effective services which are aimed at reducing the cost over the life cycle of the project rather than just the initial startup costs.

We create high quality graphics and animations and combine them with a wide variety of servlet systems, which enable clients to update areas of the website themselves through simple web forms, with no requirement for HTML authoring. This puts the maintenance of the web site firmly in the hands of staff who have access to the information, rather than relying on overworked IT departments.

The Zeus web server software we employ is acknowledged to be the fastest and most flexible in the world and all of our sites are checked regularly for broken links.

We now only host sites that we either design or provide with software services on our servers.
